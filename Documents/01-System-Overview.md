# Park Smart Monitor - System Overview

## What is This System?

The Park Smart Monitor is an automated parking violation detection system. It uses cameras and artificial intelligence (AI) to automatically detect when vehicles are illegally parked in restricted areas, such as:

- Streets and roadways (no-parking zones)
- Red-painted curbs (6-meter no-parking zones)
- Sidewalks and pedestrian walkways
- Areas with "NO PARKING" signs
- Blocked driveways and property entrances

## How Does It Work?

Think of it like a smart security guard that never sleeps:

1. **Cameras Watch the Streets** - Security cameras are installed on electricity posts or buildings, pointing at areas where parking is not allowed.

2. **AI Analyzes Images** - Every 5 minutes, the system takes a photo and uses AI to check if any vehicles are illegally parked.

3. **License Plate Recognition** - If a vehicle is detected, the AI tries to read the license plate number from the photo.

4. **Automatic Warning System** - 
   - If the license plate is readable AND the vehicle is registered in the system, an SMS text message is automatically sent to the vehicle owner's phone.
   - If the license plate cannot be read OR the vehicle is not registered, the system notifies Barangay officials instead.

5. **Violation Tracking** - All violations are recorded in the system, and officials can view them on a computer dashboard to issue tickets or take further action.
